Please follow the existing code style of the project. If there are specific style guidelines, they will be documented here (e.g., using a specific linter or formatter). If not explicitly defined, try to maintain consistency with the surrounding code.

## Commit Message Guidelines

Please follow these guidelines for your commit messages:

* Use the present imperative tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
* The first line should be a concise summary of the change (max 50 characters).
* Separate the summary from the body with a blank line.
* The body should provide more detailed context and reasoning for the change.
* Consider using prefixes like:
    * `feat`: for new features
    * `fix`: for bug fixes
    * `docs`: for documentation changes
    * `style`: for code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc.)
    * `refactor`: for code refactoring (not a bug fix or feature)
    * `test`: for adding missing or correcting tests
    * `chore`: for other changes that don't modify source or test files (e.g., build process, dependencies, tooling)

    Example:
    ```
